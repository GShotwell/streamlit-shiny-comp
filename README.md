# streamlit-shiny-dash

This repo illustrates some differences between Shiny for Python, Streamlit, Dash, and Shiny for R.
To get started set up a virtual environment and install requirements with 

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To run the streamlit app call `streamlit run streamlit-app.py`. The python shiny app can be run with `shiny run shiny-app.py --reload`. The Dash app can be run with `python dash-app.py`. The R shiny app can be run with `R -e "shiny::runApp('app.R')"`.
